<h1>The testers I used:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        List application: didn't tested automatically, but tested manually on chrome
        (including the network messages). Since this test cover most of the code, I
        focus in the tester file in some cases not covered by list app.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cookies: Test parsing cookies sent by client, and sending 'Set-Cookie' header
        back to client.
    </li>
    <li>
        Params: Test param parsing by url path / url query or body parser.
    </li>
    <li>
        JSON: test parsing json request by the server (sending json object is used by
        the list app, but when client send, it use ajax which send in urlencoded type,
        so reading json is not covered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ex3 test: the static server is still tested, and it seems to work.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Since the server log some output to console, and my testers run the server and the
    client in the same process, I silence the console log in order to get silent run.
    In case of tester failure, message will be send to stderr. In order to see the full
    output (including server output and some test-passed output) line 11 in staticTester.js
    should be commented.
