var calc = new Calculator(); - when head is loading the javascript file.
function startCalculator() {... } - when send button is pressed.
function checkNum(event) { ... } - when key is pressed in calculator input textbox.
function clearCalculator() { ... } - when clear key is pressed (in addition to calc[clear]() )
function settings() { ... } - when settings key is pressed.
function doOperation(event) { ... } - when +/*/clear key is pressed.
function updateCalc(calc) {...} - is called by several event functions which change the calc value and so 
need to update the display.
function loadEventListeners() {...} - when page is loaded, set the events to switch the display.
calculator["mul"]() - is called by doOperation() when the * button is clicked.
function checkForm() is called by startCalculator when send button is pressed.

Of course, I mean the calling of the functions, not their defining which is done during the
head section load the js file (the Calculator function are created on call to new Calculator(), 
during loading the js file too).
