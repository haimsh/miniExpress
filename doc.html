<h1>The testers I used:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        Site: This tester test the basic server feature - serving the www folder by HTTP protocol.
        The tester read the www folder, and for each file, create http request for
        the file, and compare the response to the file content.
    </li>
    <li>
        MultiServer: Test server with different url path.
        The tester use the same miniExpress app for several rootFolders (all
        reference to www folder), and try to request small file via http module.
    </li>
    <li>
        TestBody: This tester test handle of requests with body.
        It open net connection to server, and simulate HTTP request with body, and
        second adjoin HTTP request. The server should reply succesfully to both
        requests.
    </li>
    <li>
        TestKeepAlive: This tester test handle of requests with body.
        It open net connection to server, and simulate HTTP request with body, and
        second adjoin HTTP request. The server should reply successfully to both
        requests.
        The tester is called by different various of http-persistent options.
    </li>
    <li>
        LoadTest: This test the server work under DOS attack.
        It create lot of net connections, and check how many of them are responded,
        and check the respond. Limit differ between systems and runs, but on my PC,
        on simultaneity 2048 requests, the server may respond 1500-2000 of them, and
        will stay open for later connections. The tester also check that few seconds
        after the attack the server is available.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Since the server log some output to console, and my testers run the server and the
    client in the same process, I silence the console log in order to get silent run.
    In case of tester failure, message will be send to stderr. In order to see the full
    output (including server output and some test-passed output) line 11 in staticTester.js
    should be commented.
